/**
 * The Two Activities app provides a text entry field and a Send button (the
 * button_main id). Clicking Send launches the Second activity with the entered
 * text shown in the text_header view of the Second activity.
 *
 * The first Espresso test performs a click on the main activity's button, and
 * checks to see if the text_header matches what is displayed. If it passes, it
 * means that the second activity was started. The test then clicks the second
 * activity's button, and checks to see if the text_header_reply matches what is
 * displayed. If it passes, it means that the main activity was started from the
 * second activity.
 *
 * The second test locates the view containing the editText_main view, enters
 * the text "This is a test." and clicks the main button. It then compares the
 * text_message with the assertion "This is a test." If it passes, it means that
 * the entered text was successfully passed to the text_message field.
